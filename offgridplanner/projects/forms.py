If the demand estimation function is not used, a corresponding time series must be uploaded later in the 'Demand Estimation' section.
    "do_grid_optimization": _(
        "Spatial Grid Optimization",
    ),  # TODO if set False then disable step 'grid_design' and display warning A demand is required for the design optimization of energy converters. Demand estimation requires information about consumers, which is defined in the 'Consumer Selection' section using the integrated mapping system. Therefore, even if grid planning is not carried out, consumers must still be specified unless a custom demand time series is uploaded in the 'Demand Estimation' section. In that case, also deactivate 'Demand Estimation' to skip the consumer definition step.
