      <strong>III. General information on data processing</strong>
    </h4>
    <strong>1. Scope of the processing of personal data</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    We process personal data of our users in principle only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website and our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users is regularly carried out only after their consent. An exception applies in those cases where obtaining prior consent is not possible for actual reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>2. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing operations involving personal data, Article 6 (1) lit. a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) serves as the legal basis.
    <br />
    When processing personal data that is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.
    <br />
    If processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 (1) lit. c DSGVO serves as the legal basis.
    <br />
    In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make processing of personal data necessary, Art. 6 (1) lit. d DSGVO serves as the legal basis.
    <br />
    If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former interest, Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO serves as the legal basis for the processing.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>3. Data erasure and storage period</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. Storage may take place beyond this if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in Union regulations, laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject. Blocking or deletion of data will also take place if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or performance of a contract.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h4>
      <strong>IV. Provision of the website and creation of log files</strong>
    </h4>
    <strong>1. Description and scope of data processing</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    With each call to our website, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the calling computer.
    The following data is collected in this process:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>Information about the browser type and version used</li>
      <li>The operating system</li>
      <li>The Internet service provider</li>
      <li>The IP address of the user</li>
      <li>The date and time of access</li>
      <li>Websites from which the users system accesses our website</li>
      <li>Websites that are accessed by the users system via our website</li>
    </ol>
    The data is also stored in the log files of our system. Storage of this data together with other personal data does not take place.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>2. legal basis for data processing</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>3. purpose of data processing</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable delivery of the website to the users computer. For this purpose, the IP address of the userin must remain stored for the duration of the session.
    <br />
    The storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, we use the data to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.
    <br />
    In these purposes also lies our legitimate interest in data processing according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>4. Duration of storage</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose of their collection. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session has ended.
    <br />
    In the case of storage of data in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. Storage beyond this period is possible. In this case, the IP addresses are deleted or alienated, so that an assignment of the calling client is no longer possible.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>5. Possibility of objection and removal</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files is mandatory for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility of objection on the part of the userin.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h4>
      <strong>V. Business contacts</strong>
    </h4>
    <strong>1. Description and scope of data processing</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    On our website, the email addresses of all employees are mentioned for the possibility of contacting them. If a user takes advantage of this option, the personal data of the user transmitted with the e-mail will be stored.
    <br />
    In this context, the data will not be passed on to third parties. The data will be used exclusively for processing the conversation.
    <br />
    <br />
    Contact data transmitted to the RLI in person, by telephone or by other means for the purpose of conducting business or exchanging information in the context of research work may also be stored electronically. Again, this information will not be shared with third parties.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>2. Legal basis for data processing</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Legal basis for the processing of data is, in the presence of consent of the userin Art. 6 para 1 lit. a DSGVO.
    <br />
    Legal basis for the processing of data transmitted in the course of sending an e-mail, by telephone or in person is Art. 6 para 1 lit. f DSGVO. If the contact aims at the conclusion of a contract, the additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>3. purpose of data processing</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    In the case of contact by e-mail, telephone or in person, this also constitutes the necessary legitimate interest in the processing of the data. The processing of personal data serves the initiation and fulfillment of orders as well as the establishment and maintenance of business relationships and thus the performance of our business or academic work.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>4. Duration of storage</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. For the personal data sent by e-mail, this is the case when the respective conversation has ended. The conversation is ended when it can be inferred from the circumstances that the facts concerned have been conclusively clarified.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>5. objection and removal possibility</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Users have the possibility to revoke their consent to the processing of personal data at any time. If a user contacts us by e-mail, he/she can object to the storage of personal data at any time. In such a case, the conversation cannot be continued. The same applies to the transmission of personal data by telephone, personal or other means.
    <br />
    The revocation of consent can be made informally by e-mail or in writing.
    <br />
    All personal data stored in the course of contact will be deleted in this case.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h4>
      <strong>VI. rights of the data subject</strong>
    </h4>
    <strong>1. Right of access</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    You may request confirmation from the controller as to whether personal data concerning you are being processed by us.
    <br />
    If there is such processing, you can request information from the controller about the following information:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>the purposes for which the personal data are processed;</li>
      <li>the categories of personal data which are processed;</li>
      <li>
        the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data relating to you have been or will be disclosed;
      </li>
      <li>
        the planned duration of the storage of the personal data concerning you or, if concrete information on this is not possible, criteria for the determination of the storage period;
      </li>
      <li>
        the existence of a right to rectification or erasure of the personal data concerning you, a right to restriction of processing by the controller or a right to object to such processing;
      </li>
      <li>the existence of a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;</li>
      <li>
        any available information on the origin of the data, if the personal data are not collected from the data subject;
      </li>
      <li>
        the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, pursuant to Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in these cases, meaningful information about the logic involved and the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject;
      </li>
    </ol>
    You have the right to request information about whether personal data concerning you is transferred to a third country or to an international organization. In this context, you may request to be informed about the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art. 46 DSGVO in connection with the transfer.
    <br />
    This right of access may be limited to the extent that it is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the realization of research purposes and the restriction is necessary for the fulfillment of the research purposes.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>2. Right to rectification</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    You have a right to rectification and/or completion vis-à-vis the data controller if the personal data processed concerning you is inaccurate or incomplete. The controller shall make the rectification without undue delay.
    <br />
    Your right to rectification may be limited to the extent that it is likely to render impossible or seriously prejudice the achievement of research purposes and the limitation is necessary for the fulfilment of the research purposes.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>3. Right to restriction of processing</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Under the following conditions, you may request the restriction of the processing of personal data concerning you:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        if you contest the accuracy of the personal data concerning you for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
      </li>
      <li>
        the processing is unlawful and you object to the erasure of the personal data and request instead the restriction of the use of the personal data;
      </li>
      <li>
        the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you need it for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims; or
      </li>
      <li>
        if you have objected to the processing pursuant to Article 21 (1) DSGVO and it is not yet clear whether the legitimate grounds of the controller outweigh your reasons.
      </li>
    </ol>
    If the processing of personal data concerning you has been restricted, such data may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or a Member State.
    <br />
    If the restriction of processing has been restricted in accordance with the above conditions, you will be informed by the controller before the restriction is lifted.
    <br />
    Your right to restriction of processing may be limited to the extent that it is likely to render impossible or seriously impede the achievement of research purposes and the restriction is necessary for the fulfilment of the research purposes.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>4. Right to erasure</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    a) Obligation to delete
    <br />
    You may request the data controller to erase the personal data concerning you without undue delay, and the data controllers are obliged to erase such data without undue delay, if one of the following reasons applies:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        The personal data concerning you are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
      </li>
      <li>
        You revoke your consent on which the processing was based pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a or Art. 9 (2) a DSGVO and there is no other legal basis for the processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        You object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or you object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (2) DSGVO.
      </li>
      <li>The personal data concerning you have been processed unlawfully.</li>
      <li>
        The erasure of the personal data concerning you is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.
      </li>
      <li>
        The personal data concerning you has been collected in relation to information society services offered pursuant to Article 8(1) of the GDPR.
      </li>
    </ol>
    b) Information to third parties
    <br />
    If the data controller has made the personal data concerning you public and is obliged to erase it pursuant to Article 17(1) of the GDPR, it shall, taking into account the available technology and the cost of implementation, take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform data controllers which process the personal data that you, as the data subject, have requested from them the erasure of all links to, or copies or replications of, such personal data.
    <br />
    c) Exceptions
    <br />
    The right to erasure does not exist to the extent that the processing is necessary
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information;</li>
      <li>
        for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
      </li>
      <li>
        for reasons of public interest.
        <li>
          for reasons of public interest in the field of public health pursuant to Article 9(2)(h) and (i) and Article 9(3) of the GDPR;
        </li>
        <li>
          for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 (1) DSGVO, insofar as the right referred to in section a) is likely to render impossible or seriously prejudice the achievement of the purposes of such processing; or
        </li>
        <li>for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims.</li>
      </ol>
      <strong>5. Right to information</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      If you have asserted the right to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing against the data controllers, they are obliged to inform all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been disclosed of this rectification or erasure of the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
      <br />
      You have the right vis-à-vis the data controllers to be informed about these recipients.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>6. Right to data portability</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided in a structured, common and machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to transfer this data to another responsible person without hindrance from the responsible person to whom the personal data was provided, provided
      <br />
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>
          the processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO and
        </li>
        <li>the processing is carried out with the help of automated procedures.</li>
      </ol>
      In exercising this right, you also have the right to obtain that the personal data concerning you be transferred directly from one responsible person to another responsible person, insofar as this is technically feasible. Freedoms and rights of other persons may not be affected by this.
      <br />
      The right to data portability does not apply to processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>7. Right to object</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or (f) DSGVO; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
      <br />
      The controller shall no longer process the personal data concerning you unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.
      <br />
      If the personal data concerning you is processed for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purposes of such marketing; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing.
      <br />
      If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data concerning you will no longer be processed for these purposes.
      <br />
      You have the possibility, in connection with the use of information society services, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to exercise your right to object by means of automated procedures using technical specifications.
      <br />
      You also have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR.
      <br />
      Your right to object may be limited to the extent that it is likely to render impossible or seriously impede the achievement of the research or statistical purposes and the limitation is necessary for the fulfilment of the research or statistical purposes.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>8. Right to withdraw consent under data protection law</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      You have the right to revoke your declaration of consent under data protection law at any time. The revocation of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>9. Automated decision in individual cases including profiling</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing - including profiling - which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. This does not apply if the decision
      <br />
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between you and the responsible person,</li>
        <li>
          is permitted by legislation of the Union or the Member States to which the controller is subject and that legislation contains appropriate measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests, or
        </li>
        <li>is done with your explicit consent.</li>
      </ol>
      However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of personal data pursuant to Article 9(1) of the GDPR, unless Article 9(2)(a) or (g) of the GDPR applies and appropriate measures have been taken to protect the rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests.
      <br />
      With regard to the cases referred to in (1) and (3), the controller shall take reasonable steps to safeguard the rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests, including at least the right to obtain the intervention of a data subject on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>10. Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your residence, workplace or the place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data concerning you infringes the GDPR.
      <br />
      The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Article 78 GDPR.
      <br />
      <br />
