interest_rate,,float,12.3,%,Project,"The interest rate in investment calculations signifies the cost of capital and the potential return from an alternative investment of similar risk. It helps express the time value of money, crucial for determining the present value of future cash flows. This assists in evaluating and comparing investment opportunities. Default value of 12.3% is taken from World Bank reported average lending interest rate data of 2022. Please make sure to check this value for your project."
